# Form Validation Practice

## Overview

This repository features a form validation exercise as part of the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program. It includes practical HTML form handling with advanced JavaScript validations for both registration and login functionalities.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Validation**: Enforces rules for username, email, and passwords during registration and checks credentials during login.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Simulates a user database in the browser's local storage for account handling.
- **Interactive User Feedback**: Provides immediate validation feedback and alerts on the forms' submission statuses.

## Installation

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nadirkerem/form-validation-js
   ```
2. Open index.html in a web browser to use the forms.

## Usage

- **Registration**: Fill in details and submit; the form validates and stores user data if correct.
- **Login**: Enter credentials; validation checks if they match stored data, allowing login with a "keep me logged in" option.
